		<p id="Backstory"> Living in a city as vibrant and musical as Nashville, starting an entertainment company was not a difficult decision to make. One day, a group of friends were out celebrating at a birthday party. There were many local musicians and artists in one tiny room, sharing their work and enjoying unfamiliar tunes. Heavy reverb filled the room as one friend had the clever idea of starting a business, and his idea turned into a tangible opportunity.</p> 
	<p id="Backstory">    The day after the party, the group of friends met up at the Cheesecake Factory just to hang out. By the end of the day, they were having their first meeting about their new project, tossing around ideas and pitching names. They ran into issues while planning the event, realizing that they had to be an official business to be successful. They played around with different names and nothing seemed to fit until one person suggested “Heart of The City”.</p>
	<p id="Backstory">    Heart of The City is a group of young college graduates with a strong passion for entertainment and music. Statistics show that millennials are struggling to find employment after graduating college. Instead of waiting for an opportunity, we decided to create our own.   We are the solution of genres being under represented in Nashville.</p>
